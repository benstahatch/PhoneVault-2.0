# PhoneVault

PhoneVault is a self-hosted backup project built around Ruby on Rails, MySQL, Docker, and Linux.

The long term idea is to provide a simple way for anyone to run their own private backup server on their own hardware. The first version is intentionally small: get the database, application, storage, and restore pipeline working well before adding more unique features.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Current Goal for September

PhoneVault v0.1 should be able to:

- run on a Linux machine.
- use a local username and password.
- register one or more personal devices.
- upload and store files such as notes and pictures.
- calculate a SHA-256 hash for stored files.
- store file and backup metadata in MySQL.
- track backup runs.
- restore files.
- verify that restored files match the originals.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tech Stack

*Core (v0.1):*
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Python
- MySQL
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Linux
- Minitest

*Planned:*

- Tailscale (remote access)
- Python + PySpark (analytics, Future Work tier)

MySQL  File Storage

MySQL is used for structured data such as the users, devices, backup history, file metadata, hashes, timestamps, and security events.

The actual photos, videos, documents, and other files are stored separately on persistent storage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Database
The working schema is centered around these tables:

USERS

  ⬇ 1:N (one-to-many)

DEVICES

  ⬇ 1:N

BACKUP_RUNS

  ⬇ 1:N

BACKUP_FILES

USERS

  ⬇ 1:N

SECURITY_EVENTS

## Database Relationships

- One USER can have many DEVICES
- One DEVICE can have many BACKUP_RUNS
- One BACKUP_RUN can have many BACKUP_FILES
- One USER can have many SECURITY_EVENTS

These are one-to-many (`1:N`) relationships.

** PK = Primary Key:**
uniquely identifies a row in a table.

** FK = Foreign Key:** connects a row to another table.

Examples: `devices.user_id` references `users.id`.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Users

*Local PhoneVault accounts.*
Possible fields:

- `id`            *(PK)*
- `username`
- `display_name`
- `password_digest`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`


# Devices

Devices that are registered to a user.

Possible fields:

- `id`             *(PK)*
- `user_id`        *(FK) ➡ users.id*
- `name`
- `device_type`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

# Backup Runs

Individual backup attempts.

Possible fields:

- `id`            *(PK)*
- `device_id`     *(FK) ➡ devices.id*
- `status`
- `started_at`
- `completed_at`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`


# Backup Files
*Metadata for files included in a backup:*

*Potential fields:*

- `id`             *(PK)*
- `backup_run_id`  *(FK) ➡ backup_runs.id*
- `original_filename`
- `storage_path`
- `size_bytes`
- `sha256`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`


# Security Events

Security related activity recorded by the application.

Possible fields:

- `id`           *(PK)*
- `user_id`      *(FK) ➡ users.id, nullable*
- `event_type`
- `ip_address`
- `created_at`

Possible events:

`LOGIN_SUCCESS`
`LOGIN_FAILED`
`LOGOUT`
`BACKUP_SUCCESS`
`BACKUP_FAILED`
`FILE_RESTORED`
`AUTHORIZATION_DENIED`
`DEVICE_REGISTERED`
`RESTORE_FAILED`


# Basic Database Protocols / Constraints

- every table has a primary key
- foreign keys are used to maintain relationships between tables
- usernames are unique
- every device belongs to a valid user
- every backup run belongs to a valid device
- every backup file belongs to a valid backup run
- required values use NOT NULL
- file sizes cannot be negative
- destructive deletes need to be handled carefully so related backup records aren`t accidentally wiped out.


*The exact constraints are subject to change as the schema is tested.*


# Informal Queries

*Some questions PhoneVault database should be able to answer*

- What devices belong to a user?
- What backups belong to a device?
- What files belong to a backup run?
- Which backup runs failed?
- How much storage is a device using?
- What security events belong to a user?
- Does a file with a specific SHA-256 hash exist?
- How many files were stored during a backup run?

*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*

# Backup Flow


Select Device
     ➡ 
Create Backup Run
     ➡
Upload File
     ➡ 
Calculate SHA-256
     ➡ 
Store File
     ➡ 
Save Metadata
     ➡ 
Mark Backup Complete


# Restore Flow


Choose Backup
     ➡ 
Find File Metadata
     ➡
Locate Stored File
     ➡ 
Restore File
     ➡ 
Verify SHA-256


# Local Development

The project currently uses Docker Compose for the database environment.

Typical commands:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
docker compose logs
docker compose down
```

*Note* The local MySQL container may be mapped like this during development:

127.0.0.1:3307 ➡ MySQL container:3306

The host port CAN change, but MySQL still listens on 3306 inside the container.

# Configuration

Local configuration belongs in `.env`.

The repository contains an `.env.example` file that shows the variables needed to run PhoneVault without exposing any real credentials. After cloning the repository, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the current placeholder values with your own credentials. 

*Note:* Never push your `.env`, passwords, credentials, or other sensitive data to GitHub.
